        <h2>About Equinox</h2>
        <p>
          Equinox is a powerful Warframe that is known for its versatility and
          ability to switch between Day and Night forms. In the Day Form,
          Equinox excels at dealing high damage and taking out enemies in style.
          In the Night Form, she transforms into a healing powerhouse,
          supporting her team with powerful crowd control and healing abilities.
          Whether you're a lone wolf or a team player, Equinox can be built to
          suit your playstyle.
        </p>
        <h3>Abilities</h3>
        <p>
          Equinox's abilities are unique in that they change based on her form.
          In Day Form, her abilities focus on offensive damage, while in Night
          Form, they are geared toward healing and support.
        </p>
        <h3>Lore</h3>
        <p>
          Equinox is a manifestation of balance. She embodies the changing of
          the times, the ebb and flow of the cycle. Whether it's day or night,
          Equinox brings harmony to any mission.
